# Component Driven Design
## Expression Engine Conference 2017

This is the Next / React codebase from the "Component Driven Design" presentation at Expression Engine Conference 2017.

This is intended for code reading, however if you want to run the app there are a few steps.

First you'll need the Expression Engine back end, see [this repo for details](https://github.com/chambaz/expression-engine-conf-ee).

Then once the back end is set up and the JSON is succesfully rendered at `/pages-json/ui` then you are ready to install and run the Node app.

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
